FUTURE APP IDEA IS TO PUT THIS ALL ON A PHONE AS A TEACHING GUIDE TO PARENTS... TEACHING PARENTS HOW TO TEACH KIDS TO ENJOY COOKING AND DO SO INDPENDANTLY, ESPECIALLY WHEN PARENTS THEMSELVES HAVE LIMITED ABILITY LEVELS.  STARTING SMALL, SHOPPING LIST BUILT INTO THE APP, A PARENT GUIDE (BRING KIDS GROCERY SHOPPING, HAVE THEM CHOOSE THE FOOD, GO MORE OFTEN AND BUY FOR JUST ONE DAY AT FIRST) (TEACH SKILLS INDIVIDUALLY, STARTING SMALL WITH KNIFE SKILLS) (TEACHING INSTRUCTION READING, INCLUDINGING USING THE APP FEATURE WHICH SHOWS IMAGES FOR KIDS WHO CAN NOT YET READ)


Notes to myself:

* Learn to make a menu bar with:  About Us | Recipes |  Posts | 
* Look up inserting a picture (or possibly even a video?)
* Make a form possibly so the ingredient list can be well displayed (use an unordered list)
* Make an form or padding or css so that I can put the steps
* Additional ideas for getting kids involved list

Start small, with few ingredients and few steps.  For the first week of teaching my children to cook while simultaneously learning myself, I started small.  I focused on one side dish  (vegetable) paired with a ready made protein (think chicken nuggets, frozen breaded fish fillets, etc).  This recipe focuses on the side dish and teaching children to independantly prepare the meal.
